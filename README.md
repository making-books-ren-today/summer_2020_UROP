## Welcome to the Summer 2020 UROP for "Making Books" Materials!

At the moment, this is only a sketch! To keep track of our work, we'll keep a running calendar below.

### **Current Schedule**

Week/Dates   | Topics
------------ | -------------
Week 1       | Introduction/Omeka
Week 2       | Django


## **For Tuesday, June 16 (10 a.m.)**

-	Install Django, create a virtual environment, and follow the [tutorials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) to create a project
    -	For next time: Tutorials 1-2 (3, if time permits)
    -	Will look next time at [Django project structure](https://django-project-skeleton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structure.html) and think about our data model (levels of granularity, vocabularies)
    -	EB: will also address databases

-	Continue reviewing the sites introduced today
    -	Use Murray if helpful to you! And keep the [Clark Library’s “Why Django?”](https://clarklabs.lib.umich.edu/2015/12/05/django-for-digital-humanities/) rationale in mind—they wanted:
        -	to house a large data set
        -	a flexible data structure
        -	easy content upload capabilities so the researcher and students could upload information
    -	Do the sample sites seem to use these capabilities? How so/not?

-	Compare with the codebases (see repos cloned on this site): what aspects might we want to use?
