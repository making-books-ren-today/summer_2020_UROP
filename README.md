## Welcome to the Summer 2020 UROP for "Making Books" Materials!

At the moment, this is only a sketch! To keep track of our work, we'll keep a running calendar below.

### **Current Schedule**

Week/Dates   | Topics
------------ | -------------
Week 1       | Introduction/Omeka
Week 2       | Django


## **For Tuesday, June 16 (10 a.m.)**

-	Install Django, create a virtual environment, and follow the tutorials to create a project
  -	For next time: Tutorials 1-2 (3, if time permits)
-	Will look next time at Django project structure and think about our data model (levels of granularity, vocabularies)
-	EB: will also address databases

-	Continue reviewing the sites introduced today
  -	Use Murray if helpful to you! And keep the Clark Library’s “Why Django?” rationale in mind—they wanted:
    -	to house a large data set
    -	a flexible data structure
    -	easy content upload capabilities so the researcher and students could upload information
-	Do the sample sites seem to use these capabilities? How so/not?

-	Compare with the codebases (see repos cloned on this site): what aspects might we want to use?
