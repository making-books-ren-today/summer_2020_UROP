## Welcome to the Summer 2020 UROP for "Making Books" Materials!

At the moment, this is only a sketch! To keep track of our work, we'll keep a running calendar below.

### **Current Schedule**

Week/Dates   | Topics
------------ | -------------
Week 1       | Introduction/Omeka
Week 2       | Django
Week 3       | Django + code review + data modeling

<br /><br />

### **For Tuesday, June 16**

- [Install Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/install/), create a [virtual environment](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/contributing/), under "Getting a copy of Django's development version," and follow the [tutorials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) to create a project
	- For next time: Tutorials 1-2 (3, if time permits)
	- Will look next time at [Django project structure](https://django-project-skeleton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structure.html) and think about our data model (levels of granularity, vocabularies)
    -	EB: will also address databases...  <br /><br />

- Continue reviewing the sites introduced today
	- Use Murray if helpful to you! And keep the [Clark Library’s “Why Django?”](https://clarklabs.lib.umich.edu/2015/12/05/django-for-digital-humanities/) rationale in mind—-they wanted:
		- to house a large data set 
		- a flexible data structure 
		- easy content upload capabilities so the researcher and students could upload information
	- How might we view the sample sites as using these capabilities?  <br /><br />	

- Compare with the [codebases](https://github.com/making-books-ren-today): what aspects might we want to use? Here are links to these four Django DH sites:

    -	["Archival History of Computing at MIT, 1950-62" (MIT DH Lab)](https://comphist.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/archives/)
    - ["The Reading Redux" (MIT DH Lab)](https://rereading.dhmit.xyz)  
    - ["Shakespeare and Company Project” (Princeton CDH)](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu)
    - ["Derrida’s Margins" (Princeton CDH)](https://derridas-margins.princeton.edu)


### **For Friday, June 19**
- Complete [Django tutorials 3 and 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial03/)
- Write sample models (HA: create test project)


### **For Tuesday, June 23**
- Complete Django tutorials 5-7
- Review [comphist code repo](https://github.com/making-books-ren-today/test_eval_1_comphist)
- Brainstorm features to aid analysis: 
	- for assignment 1 (on material features)  
	- for assignments 2-3 (potentially, on English contexts and comparisons)
- Brainstorm (and put in Slack) questions for our librarians, esp. about vocabularies/data modeling

### **Resources**
- [GitHub tutorials](https://guides.github.com)
